HideHNComments
==============

Comments on Hacker News are awful. Seriously, it's a fucking cesspool.

Sometimes there are interesting stories though. This is a Chrome extension to
just hide everything that has to do with comments on the site. It makes it
better.

Installation
------------
The extension is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hidehncomments/bepfcpfcgnlnnkkcdnefflglaeggcdbn).
