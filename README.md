HideHNComments
==============

Comments on Hacker News can be pretty distracting, and sometimes just plain
vitriolic. This is a Chrome extension to hide everything that has to do with
comments on the site. Hopefully it will help you focus on content and not get
wrapped up in Internet debates.

Installation
------------
The extension is available in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hidehncomments/bepfcpfcgnlnnkkcdnefflglaeggcdbn).
